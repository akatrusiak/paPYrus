        ## installation
        
        you may need to install tkinter to your python. To first check if tkinter is insalled try:
        ```
        python3 -m tkinter
        ```
        and you should see a tkinter window open. If it does, continue with pip install. If it does not, then:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python3-tk
        ```
        if you're on debian based unix, if not you're smart enough to google how to install it. 
        
        Then:
        ```
        pip install 
        ```
